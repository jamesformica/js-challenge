# JS Challenge

Welcome challenger, to the formidable JS Challenge. Here you will test your skills to see if you are truly a JavaScript master!

## Installation

## Rules

We cannot have a challenge without rules, there aren't too many, but they are important!

1. You have to actually solve the challenge. You **can't** just return the expected output...
2. YOu **cannot** modify the input values. To keep it fair, everyone gets the same input
3. All code **must** be withing the callback function. You cannot create/call external functions or helpers
